# Smallest-Range-I

Given an array nums of integers, for each integer nums[i] we may choose any x with -k <= x <= k, and add x to nums[i].

After this process, we have some array result.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of result and the minimum value of result.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1], k = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: result = [1]
